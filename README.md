# LayoutBlocks
LayoutBlocks is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) mod that lets you place LayoutBlocks, blocks that don't cost anything and can quickly be removed using a placer wand. It's purpose is to make prebuilding structures (like complex houses or multiblock machines from other mods) easier.

The mod is licensed under [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Feel free to include the mod in your modpacks. You don't need to message me about that (you can however if you want to let me know anything).

Also, this is my first mod, so expect bugs and bad coding ;D
